Conclusion
==========

In conclusion, this study thoroughly analyzed and compared the Chang and Roberts Algorithm and Franklinâ€™s Algorithm for leader election in ring networks within distributed systems. Both algorithms showcased effectiveness in electing a leader, each with its own set of advantages and disadvantages. The findings of this research provide valuable insights into selecting the appropriate leader election algorithm based on specific network characteristics and resource constraints within distributed systems. Moving forward, further research could explore hybrid approaches or optimizations to address the limitations of existing algorithms and enhance their applicability in diverse distributed system environments.
